# Linear Slider MoveIt

This package defines the implementation of the controllers defined by ros2_control in conjuction with MoveIt2. The package was not created, but rather autogenerated by running the following command:

```
Further edits to the system can be made by configuring the system through the setup assistant. Please see section "[Editing the configuration](#editing-the-configuration)" for proper instruction.

Once this package is completed, motion planning can be performed in RViz.
