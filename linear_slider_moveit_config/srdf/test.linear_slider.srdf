  <!--LINKS - When a link is specified, the parent joint of that link (if it exists) is automatically included-->
  <!--JOINTS - When a joint is specified, the child link of that joint (which will always exist) is automatically included-->
  <!--CHAINS - When a chain is specified, all the links along the chain (including endpoints) are included in the group.
