# Linear Slider Controllers

Currently, no custom controllers are implemented for the linear slider. However, a boilerplate custom controller manager node can be found in the `src` directory for future implementation.

# Parameters
The `update_rate` in `linear_slider_controllers.yaml` is tuned to the current (09/24/24) update rate from the ClearCore microcontroller. If adjustments are made to this controller, be sure to test the update rate.
